Developers
==========

`CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ is our primary build system.
If you are new to CMake, `this short tutorial <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/>`_ from the HEP Software foundation is the perfect place to get started.
If you just want to use CMake to build the project, jump into sections `1. Introduction <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/01-intro/index.html>`__, `2. Building with CMake <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/02-building/index.html>`__ and `9. Finding Packages <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/09-findingpackages/index.html>`__.


Dependencies
------------

Before you start, you will need a copy of the WarpX source code:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx.git $HOME/src/warpx
   cd $HOME/src/warpx

WarpX depends on popular third party software.

* On your development machine, :ref:`follow the instructions here <install-dependencies>`.
* If you are on an HPC machine, :ref:`follow the instructions here <install-hpc>`.

   dependencies


Compile
-------

From the base of the WarpX source directory, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

   # find dependencies & configure
   #   see additional options below, e.g.
   #                   -DWarpX_PYTHON=ON
   #                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/sw/warpx
   cmake -S . -B build

   # compile, here we use four threads
   cmake --build build -j 4

**That's it!**
A 3D WarpX binary is now in ``build/bin/`` and :ref:`can be run <usage_run>` with a :ref:`3D example inputs file <usage-examples>`.
Most people execute the binary directly or copy it out.

If you want to install the executables in a programmatic way, run this:

.. code-block:: bash

   # for default install paths, you will need administrator rights, e.g. with sudo:
   cmake --build build --target install

You can inspect and modify build options after running ``cmake -S . -B build`` with either

.. code-block:: bash

   ccmake build

or by adding arguments with ``-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>`` to the first CMake call.
For example, this builds WarpX in all geometries, enables Python bindings and Nvidia GPU (CUDA) support:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -S . -B build -DWarpX_DIMS="1;2;RZ;3" -DWarpX_COMPUTE=CUDA

WarpX can be configured in further detail with options from AMReX, which are documented in the AMReX manual:

* `general AMReX build options <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/BuildingAMReX.html#customization-options>`__
* `GPU-specific options <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/GPU.html#building-gpu-support>`__.

**Developers** might be interested in additional options that control dependencies of WarpX.
By default, the most important dependencies of WarpX are automatically downloaded for convenience:

============================= ============================================== ===========================================================

For example, one can also build against a local AMReX copy.
Assuming AMReX' source is located in ``$HOME/src/amrex``, add the ``cmake`` argument ``-DWarpX_amrex_src=$HOME/src/amrex``.
Relative paths are also supported, e.g. ``-DWarpX_amrex_src=../amrex``.

Or build against an AMReX feature branch of a colleague.
Assuming your colleague pushed AMReX to ``https://github.com/WeiqunZhang/amrex/`` in a branch ``new-feature`` then pass to ``cmake`` the arguments: ``-DWarpX_amrex_repo=https://github.com/WeiqunZhang/amrex.git -DWarpX_amrex_branch=new-feature``.
More details on this :ref:`workflow are described here <developers-local-compile-src>`.

You can speed up the install further if you pre-install these dependencies, e.g. with a package manager.
Set ``-DWarpX_<dependency-name>_internal=OFF`` and add installation prefix of the dependency to the environment variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html>`__.
Please see the :ref:`introduction to CMake <building-cmake-intro>` if this sounds new to you.
More details on this :ref:`workflow are described here <developers-local-compile-findpackage>`.

If you re-compile often, consider installing the `Ninja <https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages>`__ build system.
Pass ``-G Ninja`` to the CMake configuration call to speed up parallel compiles.


.. _building-cmake-envvars:

Configure your compiler
-----------------------

If you don't want to use your default compiler, you can set the following environment variables.
For example, using a Clang/LLVM:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CC=$(which clang)
   export CXX=$(which clang++)

If you also want to select a CUDA compiler:

.. code-block:: bash

   export CUDACXX=$(which nvcc)
   export CUDAHOSTCXX=$(which clang++)

We also support adding `additional compiler flags via environment variables <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#cmake-language-environment-variables>`__ such as `CXXFLAGS <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CXXFLAGS.html>`__/`LDFLAGS <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/LDFLAGS.html>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

   # example: treat all compiler warnings as errors
   export CXXFLAGS="-Werror"

.. note::

   Please clean your build directory with ``rm -rf build/`` after changing the compiler.
   Now call ``cmake -S . -B build`` (+ further options) again to re-initialize the build configuration.


Run
---

An executable WarpX binary with the current compile-time options encoded in its file name will be created in ``build/bin/``.
Note that you need separate binaries to run 1D, 2D, 3D, and RZ geometry inputs scripts.
Additionally, a `symbolic link <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link>`__ named ``warpx`` can be found in that directory, which points to the last built WarpX executable.

More details on running simulations are in the section :ref:`Run WarpX <usage_run>`.
Alternatively, read on and also build our PICMI Python interface.


.. _building-cmake-python:

PICMI Python Bindings
---------------------

.. note::

   Preparation: make sure you work with up-to-date Python tooling.

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m pip install -U pip
      python3 -m pip install -U build packaging setuptools[core] wheel
      python3 -m pip install -U cmake
      python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

For PICMI Python bindings, configure WarpX to produce a library and call our ``pip_install`` *CMake target*:

.. code-block:: bash

   # find dependencies & configure for all WarpX dimensionalities
   cmake -S . -B build_py -DWarpX_DIMS="1;2;RZ;3" -DWarpX_PYTHON=ON


   # build and then call "python3 -m pip install ..."
   cmake --build build_py --target pip_install -j 4

**That's it!**
You can now :ref:`run a first 3D PICMI script <usage-picmi>` from our :ref:`examples <usage-examples>`.

Developers could now change the WarpX source code and then call the build line again to refresh the Python installation.

.. tip::

   If you do *not* develop with :ref:`a user-level package manager <install-dependencies>`, e.g., because you rely on a HPC system's environment modules, then consider to set up a virtual environment via `Python venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__.
   Otherwise, without a virtual environment, you likely need to add the CMake option ``-DPY_PIP_INSTALL_OPTIONS="--user"``.


.. _building-pip-python:

Python Bindings (Package Management)
------------------------------------

This section is relevant for Python package management, mainly for maintainers or people that rather like to interact only with ``pip``.

One can build and install ``pywarpx`` from the root of the WarpX source tree:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip wheel -v .
   python3 -m pip install pywarpx*whl

This will call the CMake logic above implicitly.
Using this workflow has the advantage that it can build and package up multiple libraries with varying ``WarpX_DIMS`` into one ``pywarpx`` package.

Environment variables can be used to control the build step:

``PYWARPX_LIB_DIR``           *None*                                       If set, search for pre-built WarpX C++ libraries (see below)
============================= ============================================ ================================================================

Note that we currently change the ``WARPX_MPI`` default intentionally to ``OFF``, to simplify a first install from source.

Some hints and workflows follow.
Developers, that want to test a change of the source code but did not change the ``pywarpx`` version number, can force a reinstall via:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -v .

Some Developers like to code directly against a local copy of AMReX, changing both code-bases at a time:

.. code-block:: bash

   WARPX_AMREX_SRC=$PWD/../amrex python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -v .

Additional environment control as common for CMake (:ref:`see above <building-cmake-intro>`) can be set as well, e.g. ``CC``, `CXX``, and ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` hints.
So another sophisticated example might be: use Clang as the compiler, build with local source copies of PICSAR and AMReX, support the FFT-based solvers, MPI and openPMD, hint a parallel HDF5 installation in ``$HOME/sw/hdf5-parallel-1.10.4``, and only build 2D and 3D geometry:

.. code-block:: bash

   CC=$(which clang) CXX=$(which clang++) WARPX_AMREX_SRC=$PWD/../amrex WARPX_PICSAR_SRC=$PWD/../picsar WARPX_FFT=ON WARPX_MPI=ON WARPX_DIMS="2;3" CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/sw/hdf5-parallel-1.10.4:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps -v .

Here we wrote this all in one line, but one can also set all environment variables in a development environment and keep the pip call nice and short as in the beginning.
Note that you need to use absolute paths for external source trees, because pip builds in a temporary directory, e.g. ``export WARPX_AMREX_SRC=$HOME/src/amrex``.

All of this can also be run from CMake.
This is the workflow most developers will prefer as it allows rapid re-compiles:

.. code-block:: bash

   # build WarpX executables and libraries
   cmake -S . -B build_py -DWarpX_DIMS="1;2;RZ;3" -DWarpX_PYTHON=ON

   # build & install Python only
   cmake --build build_py -j 4 --target pip_install

There is also a ``--target pip_install_nodeps`` option that :ref:`skips pip-based dependency checks <developers-local-compile-pylto>`.

WarpX release managers might also want to generate a self-contained source package that can be distributed to exotic architectures:

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py sdist --dist-dir .
   python3 -m pip wheel -v pywarpx-*.tar.gz
   python3 -m pip install *whl

The above steps can also be executed in one go to build from source on a machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 setup.py sdist --dist-dir .
   python3 -m pip install -v pywarpx-*.tar.gz

Last but not least, you can uninstall ``pywarpx`` as usual with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip uninstall pywarpx
